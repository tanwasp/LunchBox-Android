# Restaurant App Prototype #1

This prototype focuses on the main functionality of the app, which is the ability to search and view a restaurant's profile (including its reviews) and leave your own review (which will then be saved and displayed on the restaurant's page).
Some simplifications we made are the built-in inclusion of existing restaurants and reviews, and existing knowledge of the user's location.
Additionally, information that will be sourced from reviews, like price range, are assumed in the simulated restaurants.

The prototype can be run using the main() method in the Controller class. The input options are explained with each prompt.
