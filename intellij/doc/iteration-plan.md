In the next stage of the project, we will begin by focusing on the "Review Restaurant" and 
"Check Out Restaurant Profile" use cases is strategic as they are fundamental to very 
concept of the app. The ability to review restaurants enriches the community-driven 
aspect, while checking out restaurant profiles provides essential information to 
users, aiding their decision-making process. 

The "Create Account" and "Create List" use cases are deemed 
medium priority as they form the basis for personalized user experience. 
Creating an account is a gateway for users to access personalized features, 
while creating a list aids in better organization and personalization of user 
preferences. However, their priority is secondary to reviewing and accessing 
restaurant profiles which directly influence user engagement and decision-making.
Nonetheless, these use cases are integral for expanding user interaction and
enhancing the overall functionality of the platform.
