# LunchBox Prototype #2

The second iteration prototype focuses on expanding on the main functionality of the app.
In addition to searching, viewing a restaurant's profile, and leaving your own review,
the user can now add their own restaurant if it doesn't exist on the app yet. We also improved some aspects 
from the previous iteration, such as incorporating price range as part of users' reviews and using a restaurant's 
reviews to assign them a price category on their profile. We also record the dates the reviews are made and sort them on the restaurant's profile by recency.

## Limitations and Simplifications 
Limitations include the lack of persistent state and storage. Additionally, the accuracy of the restaurant data is limited because it relies
on unverified user input. The Add Restaurant form itself is also not very practical because it is rather extensive and requires information (like coordinates) that the user
 that the user would not have easy access to.

Some simplifications we made are the built-in inclusion of very limited set of existing restaurants and fake reviews, and existing knowledge of the user's location.

## Running the App
The app can be navigated using the screen-specific buttons and Android's back arrow button.
