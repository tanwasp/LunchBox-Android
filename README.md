# LunchBox Prototype #1

This prototype focuses on the main functionality of the app, which is the ability to search and view a restaurant's profile (including its reviews) and leave your own review (which will then be saved and displayed on the restaurant's page).

## Limitations and Simplifications 
Limitations include the lack of persistent state and storage. The filters are also limited to the name, price range, and proximity of the restaurant. 
The sorting algorithm is also limited to sorting by rating and proximity. This is because for the prototype, we wanted to demonstrate the functionality of the filters and sorts, making it much easier to 
add additional filters and sorts in the future.

Some simplifications we made are the built-in inclusion of very limited set of existing restaurants and fake reviews, and existing knowledge of the user's location.
Additionally, information that will be sourced from reviews, like price range, are assumed in the simulated restaurants.

## Running the Prototype
The prototype can be run using the main() method in the Controller class. The input options are explained with each prompt.
