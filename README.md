# LunchBox Prototype

## Description

Welcome to Lunch Box!

Lunch Box is a restaurant reviewing app that allows users to record, rate, and share their dining experiences while discovering new restaurants approved by other users. It is ideal for food enthusiasts, travelers, and individuals looking to explore new dining experiences. 

**TL;DR** It's like Letterboxd for restaurants :)

## Project Status

Current functioality includes searching restaurants, viewing a restaurant's profile, leaving reviews, adding restaurants, creating an account, logging into it, viewing your profile (with your reviews), and log out. Data persistence and account authentication is implemented using Firebase.

Current simplifications include a limited built-in set of existing restaurants and fake reviews.
